All new versions can change the implement codes whatever you want.
But for those occasions below, there are some special rules:

1. when the middle of version is even - for the version x1.x2.x3, x2 % 2 == 0 :
this occasion means this version may change user api.
users must pay attention to the version changes, especially this change.
Also it doesn't mean the api must be changed.
It is just telling - api changes only occurs when this occasion happens.

2. when api changes, what will also happens :
a. the last version before the change will comes into a new branch, and won't be back to master
b. the master will be the new version.

3. for every new release version :
every new version will be a new tag.
